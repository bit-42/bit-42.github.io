<!--
If you've found this, then great! Welcome to bit42. Who are we? What do we do?
There's probably many questions that you have. I'm here to answer them...

Have you ever had an idea that you were really passionate about but never found
the time to work on it? Have you ever had motivation to work but no where to
put all that energy? Either way, bit42 is here to help.

We build software that makes life more interesting...but there's a lot more to
it than that. Our mission is to make people happy and to do the right thing. We
believe that with a diverse group of people we could change the world. Even so,
there's more. You'll have to join to find out.

Please, explore our current projects and see if any are interesting to you. If
you have your own ideas and want to bounce them off of our team, then feel free
to get in touch.

Once you submit a PR, we'll be in touch about formally inviting you to join our
organization. We look forward to meeting you.
